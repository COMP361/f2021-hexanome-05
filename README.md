## Installation
Use Unity version 2020.3.21f1 LTS (64-bit). Select `Elfenroads` as the project root during import.
## Workflow
We will be using [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):
1. Create a branch for the topic/feature you want to work on (or check if it exists already).
2. Work on the branch.
3. When you want to merge your branch into `main`, create a pull request.
4. Review the changes and merge

If there are conflicts, discuss a solution with the rest of the team.
Remember to keep your branches up to date.
