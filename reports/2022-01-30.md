### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Hard to find time to work on the project when many other assignments are now rolling in
  * Had a hard time figuring out how to implement the variant/gamemode selection (figured it out in the end though)
  * Unifying all three Interaction / Design models proved to be more time-consuming than expected.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Learned how serialization involving abstract classes and their subclasses works.
  * Realized the M6 is very much related to COMP 303.
  * Learned about how "anchors" in UI design are different in Unity than they are for Android design.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * On the Lobby screen, the "hasSession" field sometimes gives a false positive, preventing session creation. Now we know it happens when logging in while the session already exists.
  * Lobby screen buttons (Join, Launch, etc...) do nothing on the first click, but work as expected afterwards. Still bugged :/
