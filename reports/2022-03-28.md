### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report 


### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Several team members were sick which slowed down the work process.
  * Technical issues (two members had their devices break in some way)
  * Software issues with git where it was creating several repositories instead of updating a single one.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Scrollviews in Unity are very touchy - it took a very specific setup to get them working with GridLayoutGroups.
  * Typescript sucks (making savegames more difficult than they should be).
  * Don't use several git-related softwares at once - just stick to a single one to avoid strange behavior.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * Cards are not shuffling properly anymore on game setup.
  * During DrawCard, when gold-cards are drawn unpredictable behavior ensues (faceupCards was doubling in capacity, gold cards were moving in and out of decks, etc...)
  * The infamous session-launching bug is still around.

### Team mood
