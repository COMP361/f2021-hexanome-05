### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * It seemed like we had a lot more time than we did.
  * Unity GridLayoutGroups were trickier to work with than expected.
  * Weird behavior involving the "slot" system implemented for the TownView and RoadViews which led to a code rewrite.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Realized that we were using more associations in the DC models than we needed to.
  * Monobehaviors in Unity can't be instantiated using "New" keywords - which is what led to the rewrite.
  * For the group doing m6, got much more effective at meeting up consistently and working together better.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  *  The PlayerInventory Canvas occasionally moves to the center of the screen (instead of staying at the bottom where it belongs)
  *  When launching the GameScene (the one with the Board), the SessionInfo object is not instantiated yet which causes a NullPointerException.
  *  Hosts still are sometimes not launched into the game properly. (Found out that it was not due to launching a previously-created session, but had no time to fix it)

### Contribution statement

### Team mood
