   * Attached the views to the underlying model, and ensured that the recieved state shows up on all client screens.
   * Worked with Chris to iron out errors/inconsistencies when deserializing the Server-side gamestate json.
 * Coulibaly Adja
   * Investigated and got a better understanding on how Unity UI works and figured out what needs to be created for it.
 * Cui Christopher

 * Meng Xiang
   * Met up with the rest of the M6 people several times to finish the assigned design and interaction models.
 * Motamedi Mehr Danial
   *  As stated above, did nearly all the work on the update() functions, for use when an updated-gamestate json is recieved from the Server.
 * Rojco Alex
   * Met up with the rest of the M6 people several times to finish the assigned design and interaction models.
 * Yoon Luis

### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

    * Close, but haven't quite finished the Interaction Model.

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Not exactly unexpected, but it's becoming increasingly harder to devote time to the project amid so many other midterms and assignments (should get better after next week).
  * Unexpected and unknown back pain, and so decrease in productivity for Luis.
  * Adja's computer failed again which also affected productivity.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * When testing with Unity, Debug.logs may get truncated if they are too long. Full-length logs can be found in an "Editor.log" file, in the "users" folder. Helped a lot for detecting json problems.
  * Realized we did some overthinking... Some objects/scripts (eg. ElfenroadsView) which we came up with over the last few months when trying to be as modular as possible ended up not being used at all.
  * Cleared out some inconsistencies with M6 (regarding the formatting of the IM).

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * Hosts still are sometimes not launched into the game properly. (Found out that it was not due to launching a previously-created session, but had no time to fix it)
  * Camera locks when finishing the "ChooseBoot" phase.

### Team mood
 * The coming week is the worst of the midterm-season for most of us, and burnout is setting in. Hopefully when the week is done and reading week comes along we'll be feeling better.
