### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report 

  * N/A

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Difficulties regarding deserialization in C# (specific rules on constructors).
  * As we made design decisions, we often realized they caused other problems so redesigning it took longer than we thought.
  * Our socket package was not suitable for what we wanted, so had to figure out how to redownload and use another one.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Only start to work on things when you are fully prepared.
  * Get a head start on milestones before being loaded in assignments from other classes.
  * Getting in touch with the TAs is nice to have reassurance, and so speeds things along as well.
