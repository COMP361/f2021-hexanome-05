### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report 

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * When two people are working on a Scene in Unity, merge conflicts are very nasty / nearly impossible to fix when compared to script conflicts.
  * Incorporating elements which link the Unity/Client-side and the Server side can be tricky since what's best for one may not be for the other.
  * Microsoft doesn't always specify that their functions are lazy, which caused some really hard-to-identify bugs in the code.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * If two or more people are assigned to working on a Unity Scene, it is best if they take turns working on it and communicate properly to avoid the awful merge conflicts.
  * Double-checking bugs and type mismatches across C# and typescript.
  * It's better to plan and discuss implementation between server and client extensively before both sides begin working on it.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * The occaisional session-not-launching bug is still there, though it seems rarer.
  * The Leaderboard is flipped at the end of the game (though winners and points are properly calculated).
  * When reaching the end of the game and picking "Return to title", certain unity objects are rendered null so it is impossible to login again.

### Contribution statement

 * Cui Christopher - 15%
 * Meng Xiang - 10%
