### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

   * Only was able to complete the Client Protocol Model.

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * The amount of refactoring/unifying required for M4 was truly enormous (especially between the Operational and Environment models).
  * Finding times where we all could work on a given portion of M4 was sometimes quite tricky.
  * Figured out that the LobbyService was more complicated than we thought (especially when incorporating it into the models)
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 *  Through feedback we gave eachother on the many models, we all gained a greater understanding of Requirements Specification as a whole.
 *  How to incorporate the LobbyService into the Concept and Environment models.
 *  Realized that many functions we believed were simple were actually much more interconnected than we thought (eg. verfication).

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * N/A (No programming has been done since M3, will resume it for M5)

### Contribution statement
