  * Having to explore the Unity documentation extensively to implement certain UI features.
  * Confusion and misunderstandings over the game rules.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * That problems which may seem like Client/UI problems may actually be a problem with the Server or another part of the code (and vice versa)
  * Just because something looks like it's working at first glance doesn't mean it truly does.
  * For the final - many of us had trouble with time management to write the exam at a good pace.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * The issue where occasionally players will not launch into a session persists.
  * When quitting the application, the session is not deleted on the LobbyService
  * Certain buttons need to be clicked repeatedly before working.
