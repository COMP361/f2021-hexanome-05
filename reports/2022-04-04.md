### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * The end-of-semester workload/burnout made it pretty difficult to work consistently.
  * Trouble installing required dependencies for use on the Server-side.
  * Unity "toggles" allow you to choose between dynamic booleans and normal ones - picking the wrong one by accident caused some problems.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Figured out how to deserialize the Server-side for typescript, allowing us to implement savegames.
  * The way DrawCard was structured, drawing GoldCards would completely ruin the contents of faceupcards. Fixed now.
  * When approaching these large-scale projects, the foundation is important - we should have refined the M5 lobbyservice code, since it's now causing problems.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * Attempting to leave a game during the "ChooseBoot" phase causes a crash.
  * The infamous session-launching bug is still there.
  * While saving games works, loading them isn't working.
