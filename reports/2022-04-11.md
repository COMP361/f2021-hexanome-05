### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Didn't have enough time to implement the trading functionality due to other bugs
  * Rewriting the LS-section of the code for long-polling (to try and eliminate the session-launching bug) was more difficult than anticipated.
  * Found out fairly late that certain cards and counters were being duplicated in our server - causing last-minute server problems. 
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Not to underestimate the amount of bugs which could be found during testing.
  * While the concept of certain things (namely long-polling) may be simple, the implementation may be far more involved than it seems.
  * To be very careful when building executables for testing - incorrect resolutions lead to "false bugs" which we shouldn't have really needed to worry about.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * Session-launching bug is still here (hopefully destroyed in the time between this report submission and the acceptance test)
  * The above-mentioned card duplication (again, hopefully will be squashed tonight)
  * Dealing with certain polling issues where gameobjects are destroyed while still being called in other methods.

### Contribution statement

 * Boucher Maxim - 25%
 * Coulibaly Adja - 10%
 * Cui Christopher - 10%
 * Meng Xiang - 10%
 * Motamedi Mehr Danial - 25%
 * Rojco Alex - 10%
 * Yoon Luis - 10%

### Team mood
 * A little nervous considering the two large bugs we unearthed tonight, but still hopeful that we'll be able to squash them by the end of the night. Regardless, ready to be done with the project tomorrow.
