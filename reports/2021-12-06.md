### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Model was not as precise as we needed it to be
  * Lack of knowledge involving specific things (eg. how to send LS requests through unity)
  * Missing teammates when we needed all hands on deck.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 *  Not to work until 2am.
 *  Realize how much we don't know about certain things, so we'll allocate more time than we think we need later on.
 *  Need to figure out a better way to debug our code when problems arise.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * Deserialization is not working.
 * Long-polling not working for the LobbyScreen.
 * When building in Unity, some functions have weird behavior which do not occur in the editor.
 * The login is not case-sensitive, which causes unexpected behavior (eg. not being able to delete) later.
