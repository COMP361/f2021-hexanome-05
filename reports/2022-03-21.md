### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Misunderstandings about certain game rules (like the Auction)
  * Found easier-to-implement Unity functionalities which, though similar, were worth using instead.
  * Due to how differently the exchange spell works, it was tricky to implement in the client-side.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Learned how to better take advantage of Unity's inspector to assign scripts and their functionalities in a cleaner way.
  * Plan to do a little bit every day, instead of large chunks at a time.
  * It may be worth familiarizing ourselves with each part of the project in case someone is unexpectedly unavailable.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * If playing ElfenGold, "FinishRound" never gets a server response so the game gets stuck.
  * Selecting "Return to title" still has certain unity objects rendered as null so it is impossible to login again.
  * The not-launching glitch is proabably still there since we haven't done anything to fix it, but it did not happen (maybe the server upgrade helped?)

### Team mood
 * The improving weather is also improving our mood (and hoping our grades improved as well), and so it's easier to get to work (despite pressure from other deadlines).
