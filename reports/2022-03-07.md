### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Certain provided Unity functionalities seem useful but ended up not working with our current structure.
  * Forgot about the rule at the end of "MoveBoot" where players have to choose cards to discard.
  * Even during reading week, balancing other classes was tricky.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * Learned that the previous way UI elements were laid out (using the anchors) was being done the wrong way, and were the reason for incompatibility at different resolutions.
  * Learned what override does in the context of a base class (server-side)
  * Learned (the hard way) that two classes can be in two separate files but with the same name, and the compiler will not react (in typescript)

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * The bug where occaisionally sessions will not launch is still there, though now at least we know what it is specifically that goes wrong (sessionIDs are null)
  * Bug where cards can't be dragged unless they are active on start of scene, which is the reason for the weird-looking inventory during the chooseboot phase.
  * Waiting too long on the LS screen may cause tokens to expire (need a way to refresh tokens if need be)
