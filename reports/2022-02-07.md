### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Needed to restructure the Model yet again to facilitate Update() functions, which was a shame since we thought we were through with that.
  * As we were passing over M6 models, realized certain concepts were too vague (eg. lifelines lacked detail) and needed to be discussed more.
  * It gets increasingly more difficult to manage the M6 diagrams, since they can get very large.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * How to deserialize objects which extend abstract classes using Newtonsoft.
  * It pays to peer-review our milestones from one group to another (eg. those working on m7 with those working on m6)
  * Wasted a lot of time on logging in manually each time for tests, streamlined it now.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * Rarely, the host will not be launched into the game properly (we think this occurs when a host tries to launch a session he had created in a previous login)
  * White screen of death came back (seems unrelated to sockets as we previously thought. Upon restarting the unity project everything comes back though)
  * LobbyService screen buttons still occaisionally need to be pressed twice for some reason.

### Team mood
