   * Was having a medical issue so could not work on the server this week.

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

  * Working while most of us had booster shots / were sick slowed the pace
  * Didn't expect the new socket we downloaded to have compatability issues with Unity, so had to switch back.
  * Problems getting an object to persist from one scene to another in Unity.
  
### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

  * That sockets are a pain to work with in Unity, since Unity has a "main thread" which typical non-unity-specific sockets do not run on, and so features like coroutines or scene launches are impossible.
  * Allocate more time for proofreading and generally working on M6 (after our subpar M4 grade)
  * Some info from the Design Model which seemed irrelevant for the Interaction model ended up being important.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

  * White screen of death (when changing values in the installed Unity-compatible socket assets, project sometimes deletes itself and gives a white screen. Seems to be a unity/asset issue)
  * On the Lobby screen, the "hasSession" field sometimes gives a false positive, preventing session creation.
  * Lobby screen buttons (Join, Launch, etc...) do nothing on the first click, but work as expected afterwards.

### Contribution statement
