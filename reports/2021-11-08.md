  * Coulibaly Adja
    * Not started implemting Protocol model directly yet.

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

* We did not have a good a grasp on the models as we thought.
* Confusions about the LobbyService, and where it should fit into each model.
* Had minor inconsistencies in our models (some classes/operations were the same, but with different names).

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 *  To double-check what was assigned so that work isn't done twice
 *  Ensure we're using the same class and operation names
 *  Figured out that the Server/Client concept models should in fact look similar

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * N/A (No programming has been done since M3, working on models for M4)
